			    systas Scheme


Systas Scheme is a Scheme interpreter with many features for unix
systems programming and text processing.  

For more details, see the longer README file (in "src/systas/=README")
the documentation (in "doc/systas"), and the labnotes (in
"src/Labnotes/SystasScheme.d").

systas is distributed from:

	http://www.regexps.com

Bugs, questions, port reports, patches, offers to help, etc. should be
sent to the author:

	bug-systas@regexps.com

Installation instructions are found in the file "=INSTALL".

In order to compile systas, you must have "GNU Make" (available
from "http://www.gnu.org").  Aside from that, there are no prerequists
other than a fairly standard Posix environment ("libc", common shell
utilities, C compiler) with networking functions.


Have fun,

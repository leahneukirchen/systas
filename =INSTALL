		      INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


These are generic installation instructions.  For additional 
advice for this specific package, see "=README".

In the directory `src' (a subdirectory of this directory) use the
following commands (or similar) to build, test, and install this
software:


	% mkdir =build			# [0]
	% cd =build
	% ../configure --prefix INSTALL-DIRECTORY # [1], [2]
	...
	% make				# [3]
	...
	% make test			# [4]
	...
	% make install


NOTES: 

[0] You must use a build directory which is separate from the 
    source tree.

[1] If /bin/sh on your system is not Posixly enough to handle
    the configure script, but "$SHELL" is, then run 
    configure this way:

	"$SHELL" ../configure --prefix PREFIX --config-shell "$SHELL"

[2] Run "../configure --help" for information about setting 
    parameters other than "--prefix".

[3] You must use a recent version of GNU make.  For now, do not
    use the "-j" option to make or otherwise arrange for a 
    parallel make.

[4] To run the tests, on some systems, you must "unlimit datasize".

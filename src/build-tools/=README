			The Package Framework


This is towards a replacement for `automake' and `autoconf', but it
isn't nearly done yet.

"replacement" isn't quite right.  For example, I don't care if this
ever runs on windows or VMS (except in cases where those platforms
have decent Posix environments) and I don't mind depending on a small
number of packages that in turn depend on `autoconf' (e.g. GNU Make).

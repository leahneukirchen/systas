New-patches: lord@regexps.com--2002/systas--lord--1.0--patch-14

 
**** ./scheme-library/Makefile.in

	Moved the tag line to make this file prettier.
 
**** ./scheme-library/ice-9/basic.scm
 
	Add the build-tree version of systas/scheme-library to the
	develpment-mode load-path.  This is preparation for 
	modules that are generated during compilation.

**** ./scheme-library/wiki/config.scm
 
 	Reorganized and cleaned up while starting to work out
	the install mechanisms for a release.

**** ./scheme-library/wiki/library.scm

	Added virtual topics and workbooks for "no such topic
	or workbook" for the case when the bogus topic can't
	even be created.

	Added `library home page' and `home page' links to 
	workbook and library indexes.


**** ./scheme-library/wiki/view.scm

	Dont't build a paragrahp lexer when showing plain-text of a
	topic.  Also don't parse document headers in that case.

	There's an anchor ("<a name=...>") at the bottom of every
	page.  Some browsers can't hack that if there is no text
	enclosed between "<a...>" and "</a>".  So, insert the
	customary server-app add there ("You are using LabNotes...").

	Added support for comment lines in topic plain text (lines
	starting with "%%%").

	Fixed a linking bug in the topic heading navigation links (the
	"<< < > >>" links).

	Added a macro-expander cheat for the specific string of 
	"$$$WorkbookName/$$$TopicName" to ensure that links get
	created for that string (used by PageHeader).  The problem is
	that macro expansion can't be naively recursive (consider 
	StupidMacro defined as "$$$StupidMacro"), so macro text isn't
	formatted by `wiki-render-text', so ordinarilly, wikiwords in
	macros don't get turned into links.   Overall, the macro
	expander has to be carefully thought out -- this is just 
	quick hack.

	Added the "<<library>>" markup in text to link to the library
	home page.

	Handle (limited) markup in bibliograph links.

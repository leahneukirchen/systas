 *(h0 "Credits")
 * 

I'm not even going to try and get this right, just now.

Properly speaking, everyone who worked on SCM until around 1995 gets 
some credit.  Everyone who worked on Guile until around 1997 gets
some credit.

Frankly, I lost track of all the names.

If you'd like your name to be recorded here, send me some email
describing what you did.  Hopefully I'll remember events well enough
to confirm your claim.

Here's the credit list for now:


	Aubrey Jaffer is the principle author and maintainer
	of SCM, from which Systas Scheme ultimately derives.

	Tom Lord did a heck of a lot of work on nearly every
	aspect of Systas Scheme.

	Several other people who almost certainly deserve 
	credit aren't listed here, for no good reason.

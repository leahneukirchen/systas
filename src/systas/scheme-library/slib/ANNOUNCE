This message announces the availability of Scheme Library release slib2d2.

New in slib2d2:

	* s48-0_57.init: Added.
	* array.scm (make-shared-array): Fixed offset.
	* record.scm: Changed identifiers containing VECTOR to VECT or VCT
	(but no help for scheme48-0.57).
	* slib.texi (Collections, Lists as sets, Multi-argument / and -,
	Multi-argument Apply): Improved procedure templates.
	* comlist.scm: Replaced single-letter identifier names to improve
	readability.
	* slib.texi (Lists as sequences): Updated examples per change to
	comlist.scm.
	* comlist.scm (comlist:union, comlist:intersection,
	comlist:set-difference, comlist:remove-if, comlist:remove-if-not,
	comlist:remove-duplicates): Earlier tail-recursion enhancements
	changed the element order; which broke things.  Order restored.
	* array.scm: Rewritten to sidestep license issues.
	(array=?): Added.
	* slib.texi (Arrays): Documentation integrated with array.scm.
	* tree.scm (tree:subst): Rewritten; takes optional equality
	predicate argument.
	* Makefile (docfiles): Added "COPYING".
	* mitcomp.pat: Unmaintained; removed.
	* RScheme.init: Put in the public domain.
	* Makefile (slib48): Simplified: scheme48 < scheme48.init
	* scheme48.init (slib-primitives): Pipe into scheme48, not load.
	Scheme48-0.45 the only version which runs jacal successfully.
	* scmactst.scm: Removed for lack of license.
	* struct.scm, structst.scm: Removed.  struct.scm lacks license.
	* scheme48.init (atan): Added workaround.
	* Makefile (slib48-0.55): Makes slib48, but fluid-let broken.
	* format.scm (mutliarg/and-): Requires.
	* mularg.scm (two-arg:/, two-arg:-): Added.
	* scheme48.init (*features*): Doesn't support multiarg/and-.
	* Makefile (slib48-0.45): Added ",load-package floatnums".
	* slib.texi (Installation): Added specific instructions for
	DrScheme, MIT-Scheme, and Guile.
	* guile.init: Added.
	* require.scm (program-vicinity): Improved error message.
	* slib.texi (Installation): Explicit instructions for MzScheme.
	* Makefile (pdf): Added target for creating $(htmldir)slib.pdf.
	* slib.texi (Installation): Expanded instructions.
	* bigloo.init, RScheme.init, STk.init (*features*): Provide srfi.
	* Template.scm, *.init (*features*): Put into consistent form.
	* require.scm (srfi): Detect presence of srfi-0 through srfi-30.
	* srfi-1.scm: Added.
	* comlist.scm (comlist:remove): Returns don't disturb order.
	* array.scm: Generalized so strings and vectors are arrays.
	* slib.texi (Standard Formatted Output): %b was missing.
	* slib.texi (Sorting and Searching): Section split from
	"Procedures".
	* differ.scm (diff:longest-common-subsequence): Added.
	(diff:longest-common-subsequence, diff:edits, diff:edit-length):
	Optional third argument is equality predicate.
	* differ.scm: An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm.

Slib is one of those big messes with a bunch of gems mixed in.

If you need something from slib, why not write a nice clean Systas
Scheme module containing a "100% solution"?

Until then, the module `(slib Systas)' defines slib's "require".
All slib files are loaded into that module, and all of their 
definitions are public from that module.

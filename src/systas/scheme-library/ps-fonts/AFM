                                  SYNOPSIS
                                       

 use Font::AFM;
 $h = new Font::AFM "Helvetica";
 $copyright = $h->Notice;
 $w = $h->Wx->{"aring"};
 $w = $h->stringwidth("Gisle", 10);
 $h->dump;  # for debugging

                                 DESCRIPTION
                                       
   This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class are
   initialised from an AFM-file and allows you to obtain information
   about the font and the metrics of the various glyphs in the font.
   
   All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to
   1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual
   sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale
   factor of font)/1000.
   
   The following methods are available:
   
   new($fontname)
          Object constructor. Takes the name of the font as argument. It
          will croak if the font can not be found.
          
   latin1_wx_table() 
          Returns an 256 elements array, where each element contains the
          width of the corresponding character in the iso-8859-1
          character set.
          
   stringwidth($string, [$fontsize])
          Returns the width of the string passed as argument. The string
          is assumed to be encoded in the iso-8859-1 character set. A
          second argument can be used to scale the width according to the
          font size.
          
   FontName 
          The name of the font as presented to the PostScript language
          findfont operator, for instance ``Times-Roman''.
          
   FullName 
          Unique, human-readable name for an individual font, for
          instance ``Times Roman''.
          
   FamilyName 
          Human-readable name for a group of fonts that are stylistic
          variants of a single design. All fonts that are member of such
          a group should have exactly the same FamilyName . Example of a
          family name is ``Times''.
          
   Weight 
          Human-readable name for the weight, or ``boldness'', attribute
          of a font. Exampes are Roman, Bold, Light.
          
   ItalicAngle 
          Angle in degrees counterclockwise from the vertical of the
          dominant vertical strokes of the font.
          
   IsFixedPitch 
          If the value is true, it indicated that the font is a
          fixed-pitch (monospaced) font.
          
   FontBBox 
          A string of four numbers giving the lower-left x, lower-left y,
          upper-right x, and upper-right y of the font bounding box. The
          font bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape
          that would result if all the characters of the font were placed
          with their origins coincident, and the painted.
          
   UnderlinePosition 
          Recommended distance from the baseline for positioning
          underline stokes. This number is the y coordinate of the center
          of the stroke.
          
   UnderlineThickness 
          Recommended stroke width for underlining.
          
   Version 
          Version number of the font.
          
   Notice 
          Trademark or copyright notice, if applicable.
          
   Comment 
          Comments found in the AFM file.
          
   EncodingScheme 
          The name of the standard encoding scheme for the font. Most
          Adobe fonts use the AdobeStandardEncoding. Special fonts might
          state FontSpecific.
          
   CapHeight 
          Usually the y-value of the top of the capital H.
          
   XHeight 
          Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase x.
          
   Ascender 
          Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase d.
          
   Descender 
          Typically the y-value of the bottom of the lowercase p.
          
   Wx 
          Returns an hash table that maps from glyph names to the width
          of that glyph.
          
   BBox 
          Returns an hash table that maps from glyph names to bounding
          box information. The bounding box consist of 4 numbers: llx,
          lly, urx, ury.
          
   dump 
          Dumps the content of the Font::AFM object to STDOUT. Might
          sometimes be useful for debugging.

Odds and ends for text formatting.  These modules are just growing as
needed and may develop into something more systematic later.


	numbers		--	Convert an integer to its ordinal
				(e.g. 1 => "1st")

	report		--	A weird utility for easily generating
				a multi-part, plain-text report -- 
				using output functions
				(e.g. "display") to add to the report,
				adding to various sections of the
				report in no particular order.

				It's handy.  Really.

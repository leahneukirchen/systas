These modules provide some basic data structures.

In contrast to the data structure modules in the adjacent directory
`standard', these are quick hacks -- not attempts at 100% solutions.

	hcons		-- eq?-based hash-consing utilities

	ratlist		-- an old list library, still used in 
			   some places, but now replaced by
			   (standard list-lib)

	string-fun	-- an old string library, still used
			   in some places, but now replaced
			   by (standard string-parsing)

For the purposes of rapid prototyping, the interfaces of these modules
(and in some cases, the implementations) are lifted straight out of
the SCSH sunet package.

Both the interfaces and the implementation needs a number of peaceful
mornings thought with a full pipe and a decent beer, in order to
"really crush" this functionality with a "100%" solution.  (But
remember, "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces risks to your
health.")

On the other hand, working with the sunet code is entirely worth it
for trivial reasons (like saving many many hours reading RFCs) and
important reasons, like reading Olin's commentary:

	;; [....]  Like so much of the Web, the protocols are
	;; redundant, underconstrained, and ill-specified.

Yee haw.

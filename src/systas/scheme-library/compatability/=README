These modules are for compatability with other Scheme dialects.

There is nothing systematic about this -- these are just tools I've 
needed while porting other people's code.

I would not recommend relying on this code -- it might be removed
in a future release.  If you *really* need something here, consider
writing a clean implementation just for Systas.


	conditionals	-- syntax for conditionals from FPS
	defrec		-- Olin's `define-record' syntax
	fluid		-- `let-fluid' and friends
	format		-- `format', as in Scheme48
	general-table	-- generalized hash tables, as in Scheme48

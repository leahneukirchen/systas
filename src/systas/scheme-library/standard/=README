Fundamental libraries, nicely designed and implemented.

	char-set-lib	--	SRFI-14, Character-Set Library

	define-record-type --	Convenient syntax for defining
				record types, their constructor,
				predicate, modifiers and accessors.

	let-values	--	S48-style let-values and let*-values.

	list-lib	--	SRFI-1, List Library, with some
				minor extensions

	list-sorting	-- 	`merge', `sort' and friends for lists.

	regexps		-- 	A fancy structured-regular-expression
				library -- similar to the one
				in SCSH, but nicer in its details.

	string-lib	-- 	This is a place-holder for a future
				module.

	string-parsing	--	Lots of ways to carve up strings.
				If you find yourself using any
				combination of `string-index' and
				`substring' (or anything vaguely
				similar) look here first.

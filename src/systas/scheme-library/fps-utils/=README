Utilities for use with FPS (functional postscript):

	font-sampler	- generate a postscript document illustrating
			  the available fonts.  

			  You can use this to see how slow
			  font-loading is in FPS.  Try calling
			  `generate-font-sampler' twice in a row,
			  making two different files.  On my system,
			  the first file takes about three minutes;
			  the second, about two seconds.  This could
			  be fixed by pre-compiling the .afm files.



	general		- a place where I've started to collect FPS 
			  procedures I've needed repeatedly.  The 
			  intention is to keep adding things here,
			  make a big mess, then study the mess and 
			  design some clean libraries.

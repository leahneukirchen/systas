The file "=project/package" drives the version identifiers printed by
programs in this tree.  It should be derived from a value that is
specific to the "dists" package (the parent dir).  Therefore,
"=project/package" is now a symlink to the top-level file
"=RELEASE-ID".

Also tweaked the `build-utils' readme file.

New-patches: lord@regexps.com--2002/package-framework--lord--1.0--patch-11

Added a configuration option:

      --with posix-mailx PROG

to specify a program that can be used to send email.

Added an =TODO file for package-framework.

`build-tools/Makefiles/column.sed': delete blank lines.

`cpp-to-includes.sed': escape Makefile meta-characters in prereq
lists.

Most files matching `build-tools/Makefiles/*.mk': generally cleaned
things up, fixed `clean' targets, fixed comments, got rid of vestigial
code, protected against actions with possibly empty `for' loops, only 
store build logging files (e.g. "Programs") *after* the targets they
describe have been built, use "-include" to include depfiles.

|XML processors (using Rx in)|
|XML Schema|

XML Schema datatype definitions can use regular expressions in
`pattern' facets to define the syntax of a value space.  For
information on this topic, see the *W3C* document *XML Schema: Part
2*, url:"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2".

The functions xref:"rx_xml_recomp", xref:"rx_xml_recomp_branch", and
xref:"rx_xml_is_match" were designed specifically for `pattern'
schema.

`rx_xml_recomp' compiles the regular expression syntax of `pattern'
facets.  (See xref:"Comments on the XML Schema Regular Expression
Syntax".)

If a `pattern' facet contains more than one regular expression, they
are supposed to be combined as alternative branches (see section *5.2.4* of *XML Schema: Part 2*).  The function `rx_xml_recomp_branch'
provides an easy implementation of this functionality.

Finally, `rx_xml_is_match' compares an entire string to a regular
expression -- the test required to validate a `pattern' constraint.

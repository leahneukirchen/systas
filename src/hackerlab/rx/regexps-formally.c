/*(h0 "Describing Regexps Formally")

This chapter is not ready yet.

The *Posix.2* standard (*ISO/IEC 994502: 1993 (ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.2 -
1992*)), section *2.8*, titled *Regular Expression Notation* is, at
this time, the only formal description available for regexp syntax and
semantics.  It is written in somewhat obscure english and does not
cover Unicode regexps.

In the future, we hope to provide an upwardly compatible formal
description of regexps, covering both ASCII and Unicode regexps, and
expressed in a more precise notation, suitable as a basis for formal
proofs and for the automatic generation of validation tests.

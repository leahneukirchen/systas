/************************************************************************
 *(h0 "Tuning Posix Regexp and XML Regular Expression Performance")
 * 
 * Some programs use Posix regexps or XML Regular Expressions heavily.
 * The performance of pattern matching (both speed and memory
 * use) may be important in such programs.
 * 
 * The Hackerlab C Library pattern matching functions afford programs
 * the opportunity to make space-for-time trade-offs: you can 
 * minimize the amount of memory used for pattern matching at the
 * cost of speed, or maximize speed, at the cost of memory.  This
 * chapter provides the details.

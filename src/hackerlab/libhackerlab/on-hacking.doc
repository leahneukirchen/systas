		Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
		Let us go and make our visit.

		-- T.S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock


Shall I spell out the perfect architecture for our software?  Predict
the form of what we'll build?  Construct a fictional schedule and a
list of milestones?  Prepare a glossy presentation outlining all the
planned features?  Magically forecast the size of markets and our
share?  Foretell our winning marketing strategy?  Calculate ROI over a
three year period to an impossible precision?

Or shall we speak of truth?


		Hacking

	In nightclubs, living rooms,
	   computer labs at midnight,

	Over meals and after shows,
	   when sprinklers come on at 3AM

	Fresh, strung out;
	   sober, tripping

	We have talked and talked, 
	   experimented, 
	   lived,
	   as beautiful ideas
	     took hold of our bodies
	     and led them
	here

	``Yes -- it will work like this.''

	``And like that too.''

	And we should build it this way: 
      	   without pain
	   without a master plan
	   by feel
      	     and feedback
	   informed by knowledge
	     and joy
	     and life

	After all:
	  _That_
	  is how
	  the ancestors
	  worked


And off we went.  Into academia.  Into the industry.  Each with hopes
of making real our portion of the good ideas.  Has it worked so far?

Intellegence, perspective, and initiative have become de-valued
qualities in programmers; thoughtlessness and rapidity at filling out
mediocre code templates have aquired a high market value.  Even
``new'' approaches to computing, for example Linux, are aimed more at
reimplementing what has already been done than at informed innovation
and exploration.

Many of the best hackers find that there is neither commercial nor
academic support for autonomy and sustained work on long term
projects.  When conditions arise that enable someone to carefully
design an elegant tool or a beautiful piece of computing art, those
conditions are typically unstable and the result of a very rare
accident.

Cynicism and resignation have become our survival skills.

We think this industry stinks.

	I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by
	        madness, starving hysterical naked,
	dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn
	        looking for an angry fix,
	angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly 
	        connection to the starry dynamo in the machin-
	        ery of night,
	who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat
	        up smoking in the supernatural darkness of
	        cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities
	        contemplating jazz

			-- A. Ginsburg, Howl 


Let's fix things, shall we?

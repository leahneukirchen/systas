We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-char-class
	Compare the character classes defined by
	"flux/char/char-class.h" to some hard-coded 
	character classes in the tests.

	Test some invariants such as that the `to_lower'
	of an `is_upper' character is not the character 
	itself.

	Test the value of `digit_value' for all characters.

unit-char-name
	Test the arrach `char_name' (which contains C names
	for each character) by generating a C string constant
	which is compared to part of the source for unit-char-name
	(see unit-char-name.sh)

unit-str

	Hand written invariant tests for all of the `str_' functions
	EXCEPT `str_save', `str_save_n', and `str_alloc_cat'.  Those
	exceptions are tested in "mem-tests".

	The hand written tests hit a variety of boundary cases.

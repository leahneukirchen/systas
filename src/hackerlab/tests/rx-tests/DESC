We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-dfa-ascii8
unit-dfa-utf8
unit-dfa-utf16
	Build a few expression trees by hand and use them
	for DFA string comparisons, using a single string
	encoding.

	These test low level functionality in Rx.

unit-dfa-utf-no-surrogates
uni-dfa-utf
	Build a few expression trees by hand and use them
	for DFA string comparisons.  In these tests,
	a single DFA is used with both utf8 and utf16 
	encodings.


These tests are very basic and don't exercise Rx heavily.
They are mostly useful during development to quickly debug
some kinds of regressions.

The tests in ../rx-posix test Rx heavily.

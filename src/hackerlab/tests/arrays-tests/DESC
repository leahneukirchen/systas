We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-ar
	Perform a random sequence of calls to the functions in 
	"flux/arrays/ar.h" creating a number of test arrays
	and operating on them.

	Elements of test arrays are initialized with hash values 
	based on their index.  These values are checked whenever
	the array is operated on, to look for signs of overwrite.

	The alignment of arrays is also checked (it should
	agree with FLUX_ALIGNMENT defined in
	"flux/machine/alignment.h")




unit-pow2-array
	Perform a series of random updates to a number of test 
	arrays, each of which uses a different `pow2_array_rules'
	(tree structure).  Perform the same updates on a flat 
	array.  Periodically compare all of the arrays to make
	sure they are equal.


Note that pow2_array_print is not tested.  However, if that
function breaks, other tests (e.g. unicode database tests)
will fail.

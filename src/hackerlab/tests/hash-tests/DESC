We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-hashtree
	Read a test script containing `store', `find', and `delete'
	operations followed by a `quit' command.  Keys and values
	are integers.

	Perform these operations and generate results on standard
	output.  These are compared to a file of expected results.

	The script and results are generated by a scheme program
	which uses Scheme hash tables to simulate the unit test.

	For informative purposes, some statistics about the 
	hashtree data structure are printed.


unit-hash-utils
	NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED

	This should test the quality of the hash functions
	in hash-utils.  Currently it does nothing.

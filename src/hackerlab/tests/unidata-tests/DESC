We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-unidata
	Generate a version of "unidata.txt", omitting
	some fields, starting from the unidata database
	in "libflux/unidata/unidata.h".

	Compare the generated database to the official
	"unidata.txt".



"libflux/unidata/blocks.h" isn't tested yet (but is exceedingly
trivial).  It is indirectly, partially tested by rx-unicode tests.

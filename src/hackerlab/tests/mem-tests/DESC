We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-mem
	mem_set
	mem_set0
		test for a variety of boundary conditions

	mem_move
		test for a variety of boundary and overlap
		conditions

	mem_cmp
		test for a variety of boundary conditions.
		missing tests for the case when mem_cmp returns 0.

	mem_occurrences
		test for counting a variety of values
		and boundary conditions.


unit-must-malloc
	Perform a malloc stress test which consists of a 
	series of random allocations, reallocations, and frees.

	For historic reasons, this also tests some functions
	from "flux/char/str.h": str_alloc_cat, str_save_n, 
	and str_save.

	This doesn't test the underlying malloc very effectively.
	For example, the contents of allocated regions are not
	checked for overwrites.


unit-alloc-limits
	Perform a malloc stress test using the `lim_' functions.

	Keep track of the total amount of memory currently allocated.
	Make sure that if an allocation limit is reached, allocation
	fails or forces GC, as appropriate.

	Forces the condition of exceeding allocation limits to occur.

	Uses `flux/bugs/test-coverage.h' to ensure that all
	interesting cases are reached during the random sequence of
	allocation operations.

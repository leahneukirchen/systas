flux/os contains trivial wrappers for standard header files.

The wrappers perform three functions:

	1. They simplify porting.

	2. They record the dependencies of flux on the host
	   system.

	3. They automatically include pre-requisit headers.
	   For example, "flux/os/dirent.h" includes
	   "flux/os/sys/types.h" (which includes <sys/types.h>)
	   as well as <dirent.h>.

There is only one function to test in this directory: errno_to_string.
Since that function is trivial (it wraps `strerror' so that programs
don't have to include "<string.h>") no test is provided.

We test to make sure each of the header files compiles correctly.

We don't directly test the definitions in these header files.  For
completeness, such tests should be added, specifically testing for the
features used by flux.  As a practical matter, if these header files
break, other directories will fail to compile.

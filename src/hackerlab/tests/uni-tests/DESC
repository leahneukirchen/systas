We test the installed header files to make sure they compile.

unit-coding, unit-cvt

	Both programs convert between UTF-8 and UTF-16.

	unit-cvt is based on "ConvertUTF.c" (called "cvtutf.c" here).
	ConvertUTF.c is distributed on the CD-ROM that comes
	with the Unicode standard (and presumably from the 
	unicode.org web site).  It is used here as a reference
	implementation of conversions.

	unit-coding is based on the conversion functions in
	"libflux/uni/coding.h".

	unit-coding.sh converts a UTF-8 file to UTF-16 and 
	back again, comparing the results produced by
	the two programs.

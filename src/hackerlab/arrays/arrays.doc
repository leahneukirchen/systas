/************************************************************************
 *(h0 "Arrays")
 * 
 * Dynamically allocated arrays are a common feature of C programs.
 * The Hackerlab C library provides two array-like data structures:
 * variable size arrays, and power-of-two size sparse arrays.
 * 
 * Variable size arrays are contiguous regions of memory, similar
 * to memory allocated by malloc.  The size of a variable size array,
 * measured as the number of elements it contains, can be retrieved
 * at run-time using the function `ar_size'.
 * 
 * Power-of-two size sparse arrays are a tree structure, used to 
 * represent an array holding a number of elements which is a power
 * of two.  Access to these arrays is very fast, and they are memory
 * efficient for very large arrays which are sparsely populated.

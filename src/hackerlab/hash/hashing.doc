\INTERFACES DESCRIBED IN THIS CHAPTER ARE QUITE UNSTABLE/

Hash values and hash tables are useful in many programs.  The
Hackerlab C Library provides:

\hash utilities/ -- functions for computing hash values in common
situations.  Hash functions for strings can be found elsewhere. (For
strings of 8-bit characters, see xref:"Computing Hash Values From
Strings".  For Unicode strings, see *XREF*.)

\hash tables/ -- a general-purpose implementation of variably sized
hash tables.

\NOTE:/ Only one type of hash table is provided in this release.
Realisticly, several different types of hash table are needed.
Future releases will contain additional types of hash table.

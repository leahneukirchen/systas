 *(h0 "Why Unicode?"

Why do we believe that "everyone will use Unicode"?  Here are some of
our reasons:

\A global character set is needed./ As the internet grows in
importance, and as software and data increasingly crosses linguistic
boundaries, a global character set is needed to simplify software and
the integration of multi-linguistic data.

\A single, good, global character set is sufficient./ Some systems,
notably the Posix Standard C library, are designed with the idea of
supporting multiple character sets, selectable at run time.  We
believe that such systems will, in the long run, prove to be
needlessly complex.  A single global character set is simpler.

\Unicode is a good design./ The design of a global character set must
address thousands of obscure issues ultimately encorporating expert
knowledge of every human language.  While the minutiae may seem
overwhelming, the design work must be based on a simple, well-chosen
set of principles so that the resulting character set is easy to use
in programs.  The design of Unicode appears to be well along this
path.

\Unicode is popular./ Unicode has begun appearing in proposed
standards, particularly, proposed Internet standards.  Open-source
software with Unicode support is becoming more common.

!  		Replacing *GNU* `auto*' is a Bad Idea



	Replacing `autoconf', `automake', and `libtool' is certainly
	a bad idea.  After all, those programs (pretty much) work,
	are very popular, and represent _more than a decade_ of
	collected, collective wisdom about the problems of 
	configuring and building software in a portable way.

	Any attempt to replace those programs will (like the initial
	release of the `package-framework' itself!) fall _wildly_ 
	short of the mark, failing to provide anywhere near the 
	portability and comprehensiveness of those venerable *GNU*
	packages.

	__If it ain't broke, don't fix it.__

	Unless it's a GoodIdea.

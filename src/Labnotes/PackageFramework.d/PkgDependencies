!> 		`package-framework' dependecies


Because of its special role in building other software, the
dependencies of `package-framework' _on_ other software have to be
kept to an absolute minimum.  Below is a rough list of the
dependencies there currently are.  Note that, because
`package-framework' doesn't "compile" a `configure.in' or
`Makefile.am' file, the dependencies are the same for both developers
using `package-framework' and end-users building packages that use
`package-framework'.


*) __GNU make__

*) __POSIX-ish sh__

*) __POSIX-ish shell utils__
   $= cat, chmod, echo, find, grep, ls, printf, touch, tsort, sed =$

*) __POSIX-ish awk__

!>		Porting `package-framework'


Mostly, porting the package framework should be a noop -- it really
ought to "just work" on any unix-ish platform.  So, instead of
porting, perhaps you'd like to help work on a test suite?  (See
TodoList.)

Ok, there's one area where porting can be helpful.  In a source
tree, check out `src/build-tools/platforms/=README'.  It isn't
_mandatory_ to write new platform-specific files, but it can be
_helpful_, at least for some packages that make use of
extraordinarilly platform-specific features (such as LibUnexec/).

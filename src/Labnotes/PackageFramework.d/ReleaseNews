!		`package-framework' Release News

* 2002-05-16 1.0pre1

  This is the first official release of `package-framework' -- 
  an alternative/replacement for `autoconf', `automake', and 
  eventually `libtool'.

  `package-framework' aims to be simpler, more maintainable, yet more
  flexible and more powerful than the tools it proposes to replace.


  `package-framework' is currently used by a number of projects
  at `regexps.com'.

! 		`unexec' Release News

2002-05-16	1.0pre1

This is the first release of the `unexec' library.

It has currently been used successfully on just two platforms, both
of which use `Elf32' for executables: (a version of) *FreeBSD* and
(a version of) *GNU/Linux*.

PortingUnexec to new platforms is straightforward and can, I think, be
done in just a few hours per platform.  It is almost certainly
necessary to have a recent copy of [GNU Emacs] on-hand.

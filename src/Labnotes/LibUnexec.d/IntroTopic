* Background

  [`libunexec'] is an unexec implementation snarfed from [GNU Emacs],
  then "cooked" a little bit.

  Briefly, `unexec' takes a running program and turns it into an
  executable.  When you run that executable, it's state is (more or
  less) the same as when the original program called `unexec'.  You
  can use this trick to speed up start-up times for programs that do a
  lot of initialization, for example.

  `unexec' is one of those things that shouldn't work, but can be made
  to work anyway.  Have you ever cleaned out an undermaintained
  basement in a house where people have lived for decades?  It's ugly,
  and messy, and contains lots of odds and ends that nobody can
  remember the origin of or reliably assess the value of.  What should
  you keep?  What can you throw out?  What are you afraid to touch
  :-)?  The `unexec' implementations are part of Emacs' basement.

  `unexec' implementations depend on the gross (highly non-portable)
  details of how system libraries are arranged.  They also depend on
  the details of executable-file formats (and good luck finding
  convenient and lucid documentation for those).

  This package is an attempt to turn `unexec' into something
  reasonably clean and portable (or rather -- widely ported) so that
  more programs than just Emacs can use it.  The basic strategy is to
  grab an implementation from Emacs, clean it up, and add it to this
  library.

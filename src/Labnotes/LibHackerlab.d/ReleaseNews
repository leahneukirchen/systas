* 2002-05-16 1.0pre9

  *A new buffering function,* `vfdbuf_unbuffer_fd' can be used to
  remove an established file buffer.  This is useful, for example,
  before calling `unexec'.

  *Some `Rx' bugs have been fixed* in the Posix matching functions
  (Hopefully these weere rather obscure bugs, unlikely to effect most
  programs.)


* `rx-xml-tests' still deactivated

  The test suite `rx-xml-tests' has been deactivated for now.  There
  is apparently a bug in `rx-xml' that effects big-endian machines.
  It is proving to be difficult to find without direct access to such
  a machine.  For now, to my knowledge, people are using `arch' (which
  needs this library, but not `rx-xml').  So, this is a quick hack to
  smooth out `arch' builds without making an `arch'-specific branch of
  `hackerlab'.

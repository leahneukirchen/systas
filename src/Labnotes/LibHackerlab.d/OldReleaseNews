!		News of Past Hackerlab C Library Releases


* 2002-02-28

  *various portability fixes* including one that result in an
   interface change to `vu_readdir'.

  *The interface to `opt_standard' changed.* Long-format help messages
   are now supported.

  *A quicksort function* has been added to the library.

  *A `current_working_directory' function* has been added.

  *Functions for creating temporary files* have been added.

  *`panic_exit'* now defaults to exiting with status 2, not status 1.



* 2002-02-14

  bugs in the hackerlab `tests/arrays-tests' and `tests/fs-tests' have
  been fixed (Reported and patched by Matthias Neeracher).

  You can now use an alternative shell for configuration

  `config.status' files now start with `#!' lines and the 
  `src/build-tools/scripts' configuration scripts use an
  explicitly chosen shell to call each other.  The top-level
  configure script now accepts a `--config-shell SHELL' option.

  This is a small step towards cygwin portability, and eases
  some of the portability constraints on `configure' for systems
  where `/bin/sh' is hopelessly wrong.

  (Reported by Jason Diamond and others.)

  avoid dirent portability problems

  Some portability problems in libhackerlab's use of dirent have been
  fixed.  (Reported by several people.)

* 2002-01-17

This is a pre-release version of 1.0.  (For a precise release id, see
the top-level file `=RELEASE-ID'.)  The purpose of this release is to
distribute bug-fixes.

All compiler warnings generated by `-Wall' have been fixed.  This
includes some problems that (seem to have) caused failures on 64-bit
systems.

Several users have reported success building and testing on *GNU/Linux*
while others have encountered problems.  The reported *GNU/Linux*
related problems have been fixed.

Problems have been reported on *Solaris*.  Some of these have been
fixed, others are pending.

A number of small typos and minor bugs have been fixed.

Port reports and patches related to porting are especially welcome
contributions.





* 2002-01-16

This is a pre-release version of 1.0.  (For a precise release id, 
see the top-level file `=RELEASE-ID'.)

The hackerlab C library remains stable and useful but incomplete while
I work on other projects.

At this time, the library is known to work well on the author's
FreeBSD system.  It is known to compile and pass the included test
suite on an old GNU/Linux box.

Port reports and patches related to porting are welcome contributions.

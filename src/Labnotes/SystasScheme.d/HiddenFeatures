!> 	Hidden Features of systas Scheme


`systas' has an (undocumented) `unexec' feature that can be
used to produce a fast-starting version of the interpreter
from a running process.

Also noteworthy are some of the `scheme-library' modules.
Documentation is mostly in comments in the source files.


*`(standard list-lib)'*

  SRFI-1 (the list library).

*`(standard regexps)'*

  Structured regexps -- essentially like those in SCSH, but taking
  advantage of Systas binding for the Rx regexp library.


*`(standard string-lib)' and `(standard string-parsing)'*
  
  Lots of handy string functions -- eventually to become a SRFI


*`(unix directories)', `(unix file-utils)', and `(unix filenames)'*
  
  Lots of handy utilities for unix filesystem hacking

*`(unix shell)'*

  An interpreter for SCSH process notation. Complete support for
  job-controlled processes.

* 2002-05-16 1.0pre3

  This interpreter is "back from the dead".  Development had stopped 
  for quite a while, with little or no expectation of continuing in
  any serious way.  However, two developments changed that:

	*) I found it very convenient to use this implementation
	   for the `labnotes' web-app toolkit.

	*) I found it to be not-too-hard to add `unexec' support
	   to the implemenation, which gives a satsifactory (though
	   far from ideal) solution to the start-up-time problem.

  The big new news of this release is an `unexec' feature.  After being
  compiled in the usual way, the interpreter is run, a decent number of
  core modules are loaded, and the running processes is `unexeced'
  (turned into an executable program).  Consequently, scripts that use
  those core modules can run with a quite low start-up time.

  The `unexec' feature also makes it possible to create customized
  versions of systas, with different modules loaded.  There is a 
  certain amount of black-magic to this though -- not every achievable
  process state will yield a useful unexeced program.

  The `unexec' implementation is snarfed from emacs and cleaned up
  to become a generic library.  Ports have been made to FreeBSD and
  linux -- help reaching other platforms is desirable.

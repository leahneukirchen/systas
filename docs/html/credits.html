<p>I'm not even going to try and get this right, just now.
</p><p>Properly speaking, everyone who worked on SCM until around <code>1995</code>
 gets 
some credit.  Everyone who worked on Guile until around <code>1997</code>
 gets
some credit.
</p><p>Frankly, I lost track of all the names.
</p><p>If you'd like your name to be recorded here, send me some email
describing what you did.  Hopefully I'll remember events well enough
to confirm your claim.
</p><p>Here's the credit list for now:
</p><pre>
        Aubrey Jaffer is the principle author and maintainer
        of SCM, from which Systas Scheme ultimately derives.

</pre>
<pre>
        Tom Lord did a heck of a lot of work on nearly every
        aspect of Systas Scheme.

</pre>
<pre>
        Several other people who almost certainly deserve 
        credit aren't listed here, for no good reason.

</pre>

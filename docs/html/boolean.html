<p>There are two values which are called booleans, written:
</p><pre>
     `#t'    ;; used to represent &quot;true&quot;
     `()'    ;; used to represent &quot;false&quot;
     `#f'    ;; another way to write &quot;false&quot;

</pre>
<p>Only one value in the system, <code>()</code>
, represents <em>
<a name="index-pt:0"></a>

false
</em>
.  All other
values, including <code>#t</code>
, are interpreted as <em>
<a name="index-pt:1"></a>

true
</em>
.  <code>#f</code>
 is just
another way to write <code>()</code>
.
</p><p>In the text of a program, <code>()</code>
 typically represents &quot;nil&quot; or
&quot;nothing&quot;, &quot;emptiness&quot;, &quot;void&quot;.  <code>()</code>
 is commonly used to
represent &quot;the empty list&quot;, though it has other uses as well.
</p><p>There are two important ways that Systas Scheme diverges from
standard Scheme, and this is one of them.  (The other is that
symbols and identifiers in Systas are guaranteed to be case
sensative.)
</p><p><b><u>Function</u> <code><a name="not"></a><a name="index-pt:2"></a>
not
</code></b><br>
<pre>
(not x)

</pre>
<p>If <code>x</code>
 is <code>#f</code>
, return <code>#t</code>
, otherwise return <code>#f</code>
.
</p>
<br>
<br><p><b><u>Function</u> <code><a name="boolean?"></a><a name="index-pt:3"></a>
boolean?
</code></b><br>
<pre>
(boolean? obj)

</pre>
<p>Return <code>#t</code>
 if <code>obj</code>
 is either <code>#t</code>
 or <code>#f</code>
.
</p>
<br>
<br><p><b><u>Function</u> <code><a name="->bool"></a><a name="index-pt:4"></a>
->bool
</code></b><br>
<pre>
(->bool obj)

</pre>
<p>Return <code>#f</code>
 if <code>obj</code>
 is <code>#f</code>
, otherwise return <code>#t</code>
.

<h3 align=center>Rationale -- Booleans</h3>










<p>Standard Scheme demands that nil (<code>()</code>
) and false (<code>#f</code>
) be
distinct values, and that nil be a true value.  This is one of the
ways Systas Scheme is non-standard: nil and false are the same
value; nil is false.
</p><p>We have a handy mnemonic for remembering the situation with <code>()</code>
 and <code>#f</code>

in Systas Scheme:
</p><pre>
             In Systas Scheme, nothing is false.

</pre>
<p>Systas deviates from the standard that way for many reasons, 
including:
</p><p><strong><u>0. Compact coding idioms.</u></strong>
</p><p>For example, I really like being able to write:
</p><pre>
             (and x (cdr x)) => &lt;list>

</pre>
<p><strong><u>1. Aesthetic consistency with the design of various control operators
(`and' and `or' especially).</u></strong>
</p><p>For example, <code>and</code>
, applied to homogenously typed arguments, returns
a value of the same type iff that type includes boolean false.
That encourages the use of boolean false as a member of
non-primitive types to represent the default distinguished case,
when there is just one distinguished case.
</p><p>(So, applying that aesthetic: <code>#f</code>
 is good as end-of-list, because
EOL is the natural and unique distinguished case of lists.  But <code>#f</code>

is not good as the number <code>0</code>
, because while <code>0</code>
 is <em>sometimes</em> the
natural distinguished case for a particular use of numbers, often
the distinguished case is <code>1</code>
 or some other number.)
</p><p><strong><u>2. Better type isomorphism of a subset of Scheme types and a subset of
Common Lisp types.  A step in the direction of a universal standard
for basic s-expressions.</u></strong>
</p><p>This would simplify both the exchange of data between CL and
Scheme, and the possibility of a single implementation supporting
both languages.  Similarly for Scheme and Emacs Lisp.
</p><p>It would be a step in the direction of making basic s-expression
types a fundamental unit of exchange between programs in all
languages.
</p><p>I find it irksome, for example, the way XML has evolved.  A very
simple idea -- recursively structured data over simple primitive
types -- is mixed up with some arbitrary restrictions (e.g. each
node has a keyword-parameterized header followed by a list of
sub-nodes).  If the Scheme designers had thought of the basic types
as something that could be usefully standardized across languages,
we might have general s-expressions instead of XML, and Scheme or
another simple Lisp as the language in which to express and
exchange (operational) standards for various kinds of type
checking, transformations, etc.  
</p><p>Consider XML Schema.  A type system of superior power and greater
simplicity could have been specified precisely and operationally 
as a few pages of Scheme code (start with something like Wright's
pattern matcher, for example).  Instead, we have a huge and fairly
complex specification, rarely implemented or implemented correctly
in the public code base, and offering further evidence for the old
adage about sufficiently complex programs and common lisp.
</p><p>Using s-expression types as the data exchange format would lead
naturally to using Emacs, Emacs-compatible, and Emacs-like programs
as extensible front-ends.  Instead, we have absurdly complex web
browsers fronting for programs exchanging XML data.  Maybe we need
a new adage: any sufficiently complex web browser is condemned to
re-implement most of Emacs -- poorly and with <code>10</code>
 times as much
code.
</p><p><strong><u>3. Accumulated experience and programming idioms from the larger lisp
world.</u></strong>
</p><p>We should give a lot of weight to the accumulated history and
experience represented by CL.  We should avoid diverging from it
except where there are very clear reasons for doing so.
